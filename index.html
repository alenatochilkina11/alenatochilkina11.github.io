            She was born and raised in Moscow, Russia, and she began her studies in the US as a high school sophomore in 2016.
            Alena transferred to Georgia Tech from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, in Fall 2022.
            At Case, she was a pre-medicine student, a member of the medical fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon,
            and she worked at a Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center's laboratory.
            In addition, Alena volunteered as a math tutor for 1st - 12th-grade students in her community.
            In her free time, she enjoys playing tennis, working out, watching soccer (she's a huge Tottenham fan), and spending time with her friends.</p>
